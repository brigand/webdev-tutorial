## WebDev Tutorial Series Code

Find all the code for [aboutscript](http://youtube.com/user/aboutscript)'s web development series.

### Getting code

#### GitHub method

Select gh-pages in the branch drop-down on GitHub.  To find code for the end of a given video, click on the "Tags" button, and then find the tag appearing in the video's title.  They're named as `{video_round}-{language}`.  For example, the tag `3-CSS` would mean the third CSS video.

On Windows, press "Source Code (zip)".  On Linux or MacOS, the tar.gz file is smaller, but either can be downloaded.  Extract, and click on index.html to open it in your default browser.

#### Command Line Method

```
git clone https://github.com/brigand/webdev-tutorial.git
git checkout gh-pages
git checkout {video_round}-{language}
```

Replace `{video_round}-{language}` with the tag name found in the name of the video, e.g., 3-CSS.


### Have a question?

Create an issue on GitHub, or send an email to aboutscript [at] gmail.com.  I prefer to not recieve messages on YouTube due to lack of flexibility in responses (sharing code, formatting, record keeping, etc.).
