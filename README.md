## WebDev Tutorial Series Code

Find all the code for [aboutscript](http://youtube.com/user/aboutscript)'s web development series.

### Getting code

Select gh-pages in the branch drop-down on GitHub.  To find code for the end of a given video, click on the "Tags" button, and then select the tag appearing in the video's title.  They're named as `{video_round}-{language}`.  For example, the tag `3-CSS` would mean the third CSS video.

### Have a question?

Create an issue on GitHub, or send an email to aboutscript [at] gmail.com.  I prefer to not recieve messages on YouTube due to lack of flexibility in responses (sharing code, formatting, record keeping, etc.).
